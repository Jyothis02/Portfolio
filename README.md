This website includes 4 main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

// Structure
The header includes the logo and a navigation bar with links to each of the 4 sections.

Home section features a responsive image, a brief introduction, clickable social media icons (that redirect to respective platforms), and a button that jumps to the Projects section.

About section provides a short description and displays 4 informative boxes using a grid layout. (These boxes are responsive too.)

Projects section showcases 3 project cards with images and short descriptions. Two of them include hyperlinks that redirect to detailed project pages.

Contact section allows users to get in touch via a form or by emailing through the provided email link.

A footer is present at the bottom of the page.

// Responsive
The entire website is fully responsive and works well on phones, tablets, and laptops, maintaining proper proportions for each element.

The image in the Home section adjusts based on screen size.

The boxes in the About section re-align for smaller screens.

// Theme
The site follows a consistent black and yellow theme applied throughout all sections.

Each element is styled using hover effects, borders, and box shadows to match the theme and enhance interactivity.

// Extra
Visual elements are enhanced using external sources linked via the <link> tag.

A small JavaScript snippet handles the active navigation highlighting based on user clicks.
